# Speech Recognition Repository

This project implements a comprehensive speech recognition pipeline using advanced signal processing techniques and deep learning. The system processes audio signals, extracts relevant features, and employs neural networks to recognize and classify speech patterns.
Key Features

Audio Recording and Processing: Capture and manipulate audio signals using wave and pyaudio libraries
Time-Domain Feature Extraction: Calculate amplitude envelope, RMS energy, and zero-crossing rate for temporal analysis
Frequency-Domain Analysis: Apply Fourier Transform to convert signals from time domain to frequency domain
Spectrogram Generation: Create visual representations of the spectrum of frequencies in audio signals
Mel-Spectrogram Extraction: Generate perceptually relevant audio features using the Mel scale
PyTorch Integration: Implement deep learning models for audio classification and pattern recognition
